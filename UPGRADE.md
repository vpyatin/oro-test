The `var/attachment` and `var/import_export` directories are no longer used for storing files and have been removed from the default directory structure.

All files from these directories must be moved to the new locations:
- from `var/attachment/protected_mediacache` to `var/data/protected_mediacache`;
- from `var/attachment` to `var/data/attachments`;
- from `var/import_export` to `var/data/importexport`;
- from `var/import_export/files` to `var/data/import_files`;
- from `var/import_export/product_images` to `var/data/import_files`.

The console command `oro:gaufrette:migrate-filestorages` will help to migrate the files to new structure.
